## 👋 Hi

I build user-centric web interfaces with a strong emphasis on performance, clean code and great UX.  
Rock ’n’ roll lover 🎸.

## 💼 What I’m working on

- Crafting and refining this personal site to highlight my front-end work, tools and processes.
- Building dynamic data-driven UI components (grids, toggles, filters) using modern frameworks and libraries (Next.js v15, React, Framer Motion, etc.).
- Constantly experimenting with performance optimization, accessibility and responsive design.

## 💼 Recent projects

- [Movies & TV Series](https://www.moviesandtvseries.online/)

## 🧠 What I’m currently learning

- Deepening my understanding of the App Router in Next.js v15 and how to structure large-scale front-end applications.
- Creating fluid animations with Framer Motion and integrating them into real-world layouts seamlessly.
- Building reusable UI systems (design tokens, theming, component libraries) to scale front-end codebases efficiently.
